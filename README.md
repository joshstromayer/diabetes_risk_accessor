# Diabetes Risk Assessor
A simple model.

There are many demographic and biological factors that can influence the likelihood of developing diabetes. Each factor having its own unique contribution. Simple models arent good at telling us how each factor contributes to the risk of diabetes, rather to tell us whether or not one has diabetes or not. 

This webpage has been created to solve that issue. After inputting your data the model does not tell you whether or not you have diabetes, as there are many other factors that can affect this outcome. Rather, the webpage tells you how each individual factor affects this outcome.
